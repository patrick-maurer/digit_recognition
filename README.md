Neural network with stochastic gradient descent for MNIST handwritten digit recognition.

Following a tutorial of [GormAnalysis](https://github.com/ben519) I have learned the basics of how neural networks work. Now I'm looking forward to tackling more advanced projects and working with various libraries.

The training data can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv?select=mnist_test.csv).
